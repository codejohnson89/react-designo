## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Your Message` fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
- **Bonus**: View actual locations on the locations page maps (we recommend [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) for this)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS/Sass
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Create-React-App](https://create-react-app.dev/) - Set up a modern web app by running one command.
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) - For styles
- [React-Hook-Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - Performant, flexible and extensible forms with easy-to-use validation.

### What I learned

I used for the first time react-hook-forms js library. This helps with form validation and with re-rendering after typing text into the input fields. This helps with code to be optimal.


### Continued development

In the future I will add the ability to send a email when a user submits the form.
